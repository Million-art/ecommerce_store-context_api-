# E-commerce Context API

## Description  
The **E-commerce Context API** project is a simple online store application built using **React** and **Context API**. The main goal of this project is to learn and practice the use of **React Context API** for state management in a large React application. The project mimics an e-commerce store where users can browse products, add them to the cart, and view the total amount of their purchases.

This project is ideal for anyone looking to understand how to manage global state in React using **Context API** and build a basic e-commerce application.



## Features  
- **Global State Management**: Use of React Context API to manage the cart state and user preferences globally throughout the application.  
- **Add/Remove Items from Cart**: Users can add and remove products from their cart in real-time.  
- **Total Cart Calculation**: Displays the total price of items in the cart, updating dynamically as products are added or removed.  
- **Product List**: Displays a list of sample products with options to add them to the shopping cart.  
- **Cart Persistence**: The cart data persists even after refreshing the page (using browser local storage or similar methods).
