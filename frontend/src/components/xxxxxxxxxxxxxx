To manage the total when the quantity is increased on a cart page using context and useReducer,
 you can follow these steps:
 1. Create a context: Set up a context using the createContext() function. This context will hold the state and dispatch function for your cart.
 2. Set up initial state: Define an initial state object that represents the cart.
  It should include an array of items with properties like name, price, and quantity.
 3. Create a reducer: Write a reducer function that handles different actions to update the cart state.
  One action could be "INCREASE_QUANTITY" which increments the quantity of a specific item in the cart.
 4. Dispatch the action: In your cart page component, use the useContext() hook to access the cart context and retrieve the dispatch function.
  When the user increases the quantity of an item, dispatch the "INCREASE_QUANTITY" action with the appropriate payload (e.g., the item ID).
 5. Update the state: In the reducer, handle the "INCREASE_QUANTITY" action.
  Find the item in the cart based on the payload (item ID) and update its quantity accordingly. 
  You can calculate the new total by iterating over the items in the cart and summing up the prices multiplied by the quantities.
 6. Display the total: In your cart page component, you can now access the updated total from the cart state and display it to the user.
 By following these steps, you can manage the total when the quantity is increased on your cart page using context and useReducer.
